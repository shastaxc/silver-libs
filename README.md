# SilverLibs
FFXI Windower v4 GearSwap library. Hooks into GearSwap to provide additional advanced functionality.

The SilverLibs.lua file contains functionality that is designed to be easily implemented into job files. To use any of these functions, follow the instructions below.

You may reference my personal GearSwap job files if using Mote's libraries for help implementing these features, you can find them at https://github.com/shastaxc/gearswap-data

There are no solid examples for implementing this with Selindrile's libraries but it should work as well.

For installation help, feature implementation instructions, and feature descriptions, please visit the wiki at https://github.com/shastaxc/silver-libs/wiki
